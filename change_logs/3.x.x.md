# Changes
## Fixes
- Fixed an issue with ``[p]themeset`` which showed the incorrect error when trying to create a monster
- ``[p]themeset add monters`` now enforces title case for monsters created.
- Revert changes to casing in ``themeset`` so now the monster name is case sensitive
- ``[p]themeset list`` can now be used by server admins and owners
